# SlideDemo

<sup><i>This projects purpose was mainly for testing out stuff during development but I figured<br/>
it might be a good idea to put it up here as example of how Mgx might be used.</i></sup>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The wizard will lead you through the installation of the application.

### MacOS
Download the pre packed SlideDemo.zip and place it anywhere on your system.<br />
